    "# Ising Model\n",
    "Ising model is one of the more famous models in statistical physics. The system studied in the model has 'spins' located at vertices of a (possibly infinite) lattice, and spins interact with their neighbours using a specific rule (like spins stabilize the energy and unlike spins destabilize the energy) and iteract with external field B; thus  the energy of the system is given as: \n",
    "$$ U = - \\sum_i B\\sigma_i - \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{\\langle i,j \\rangle} J \\sigma_i \\sigma_j\n",
    "$$\n",
    "In the simple version of the model, $\\sigma_i = \\pm 1$, and system is maintained at temperature $T$; the probability of a particular configuration is given by the Boltzmann Probability Law:\n",
    "    $$ P(\\{\\sigma_i\\}_{i=1}^N) \\propto \\exp\\left[-\\beta U(\\{\\sigma_i\\})\\right]\n",

    "## Periodic Boundary Conditions\n",
    "To simulate a infinite system, it is common to use Periodic Boundary Conditions (PBC). As illustraition consider 1-dimensional (1D) lattice, which is nothing but a straight line, with $N$ spins placed with equal spacing between two contigious spins. This chain of spins has left-end and right-end making this a finite system; however if we place this chain of spins on a circle such that in addition to requiring that distance between contigious spins is 1 unit, we require the distance betwen left-end and right-end of chain is 1 unit. We now see that the chain becomes *infinite*.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can imagine similar trick in 2 dimensions, by requiing PBC in x-direction and y-directions. And, in 3-dimensions, requiring PBC in x-direction, y-direction and z-directions. \n",

    "### A specific trick applicable only for Ising Model for periodic boundary conditions\n",
    "Add one extra row and one extra column to the configuration; the additional column/row is the copy of first column/row. "
